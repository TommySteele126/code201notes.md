     1. RGB ` color : rgb(0-255,0-255,0-255)` 
     2. Hex codes `color : #ee3e80`
     3. Color names `color : red;`

* We can choose the background or foreground color using this ways .
* each element have a background color value .
* When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
     * **low constract** lower contrast between background and foreground colors.
     * **meduim constract** For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
     * **high constract** higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
